# Image-Generation-using-Stable-Diffusion-ComfyUI
This project utilizes Stable Diffusion for generating diverse, high-quality images based on the user's input. This system integrates with ComfyUI, a user friendly interface, to unable users to customize the inputs and workfows effectively.

A stable diffusion model is a type of generative model used in machine learning where itâ€™s used to slowly add noise to data (like an image) and then reverse it to create new, similar data (like generating new images).
ComfyUI is a user-friendly tool for generating images with Stable Diffusion. It provides an intuitive way to experiment with different settings without coding.
